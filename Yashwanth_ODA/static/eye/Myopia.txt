What is myopia?
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a refractive defect or error in visual focusing. Images are focused in front of the retina and not on it, making long distance vision difficult.

Myopia usually appears in childhood and develops approximately until the age of 20, when it tends to stabilise.

If the refractive error is greater than eight dioptres, it is referred to as high myopia, which can involve serious specific visual risks and complications.

What causes it?
It occurs when the eyeball is elongated or the cornea is more curved than usual. People with a family history of myopia are more likely to suffer from it.

How can it be prevented?
It is not possible to prevent myopia. Regular eye tests however, especially for children, help to detect it in its early stages.


A myopic or nearsighted person sees objects clearly if they are close up, but blurred if they are at a distance. It usually appears in school-age children, so it is important to be attentive to possible symptoms.

SYMPTOMS:-

Difficulty in seeing what the teacher writes on the blackboard
Holding books very close to the eyes to read
Sitting close to the television
Squinting to make distant objects appear sharper
As myopia develops while children are growing, it is necessary to change glasses or contact lenses frequently.
