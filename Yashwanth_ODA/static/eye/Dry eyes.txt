What Causes Dry Eyes?
Sometimes, there's a lack of balance in your tear-flow system. Or your air conditioner, heater, or other things around you could dry out your tear film. Other causes include:

The natural aging process, especially menopause
Side effects of certain drugs like antihistamines
Diseases that affect your ability to make tears, like Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and collagen vascular diseases
Problems that don’t allow your eyelids to close the way they should.

Symptoms:
A gritty feeling
Feeling like there’s something in your eye
Itching
Redness
Blurry vision
Light sensitivity

How Are Dry Eyes Treated?
There are a number of options. Ask your eye doctor what to do. Treatments include:

Artificial tear drops and ointments. This is the most common treatment. Many types of drops are available over the counter. No one product works for everyone, so you might have to try a few to figure out the one that’s right for you. If you have chronic dry eye, you need to use the drops even when your eyes feel fine, or they won’t stay wet enough. If your eyes dry out while you sleep, you can use a thick product, like an ointment, at night. You might think about sleeping with airtight goggles on. They'll create a mini "moisture chamber" for your eyes.
