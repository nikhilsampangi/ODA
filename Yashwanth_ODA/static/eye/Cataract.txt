What is a cataract?
A cataract is the loss of transparency of the crystalline lens, the eye’s natural lens located behind the pupil. Rays of light pass through this lens to reach the retina, where images are formed. If the lens becomes less transparent and obstructs the passage of light to the retina, the patient suffers from a progressive loss of vision.

What causes it?
As people get older, the crystalline lens becomes more opaque. Aging is the main cause of cataracts.

There are other factors unrelated to age, however, cataracts can be caused by genetic predisposition, trauma, diseases of the eye or the organism (e.g. diabetes) or the consumption of certain drugs. In some cases, a cataract is congenital, i.e. present from birth. 


How can it be prevented?
Cataracts cannot be prevented, but they can be detected by eye check-ups. It is advisable to see an ophthalmologist, especially after the age of 45, to detect the possible existence of a cataract, its type, size and location, and to determine whether surgery is required and when it should be carried out.

Depending on the size and location of opaque areas on the crystalline lens, the patient may not notice the development of a cataract.

These are some of the most common symptoms:

Blurred and sometimes double vision when a cataract is forming
Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
Better vision on cloudy days than on sunny days
Glasses are no longer required for near vision
Driving at night becomes more difficult
Prescription glasses need to be changed more frequently
After the age of 50, myopia may worsen, or alternatively, eyesight may inexplicably improve. This occurs because the cataract can cause some changes to the lens, creating a magnifying glass effect
